# Venn Diagram Visualization for Linear Control Theory Classifications

## About
I wanted to plot a Venn diagram to visualize the various system classifications covered in today's lecture of **Electrical Linear Control Theory (Lecture 2)**. The goal is to represent different control system categories and their interrelations, helping in understanding the behavior and classification of systems in linear control theory.

## Purpose
The visualization serves as a tool to understand the overlap between different system types discussed in the lecture, aiding in grasping how they fit into the larger framework of control theory.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/adlikestocode/SystemClassificationn_venndiagram/new/master?filename=README.md>
